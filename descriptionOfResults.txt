Test results: As the results show in the first line, that the first test with integers passed, notated with a period (.), while the second test with fractions failed, notated with an F.
It goes on to explain the failure, showing the name of the function that failed, and the main function. 
In the assertion section, it shows that I tested for the result to be equal to 1, but the Assertion Error shows that the real result was 0.9 and not 1, so that is why this test failed.
